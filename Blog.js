Top speed is 211 MPH. The size of the tire is 305/30 R20. The Ferrari's engine hits a pleasantly sonorous note as it does its work, and the brakes do a masterful job of bringing it to a swift halt. This Ferrari is quick enough to make an indelible impression. The F8 Tributo and Spider are rated at 15 mpg in the city and between 18 and 19 mpg on the highway. The cabin's most notable shortcoming concerns rearward visibility in the coupe. The view out the back is impeded by the rear window's louvers. Many exotics are very low on cargo space, and the F8 is no exception. Cargo capacity stands at seven cubic feet in the coupe.</p>",
