Top speed is 211 MPH. The size of the tire is 305/30 R20. The Ferrari's engine hits a pleasantly sonorous note as it does its work, and the brakes do a masterful job of bringing it to a swift halt. This Ferrari is quick enough to make an indelible impression. The F8 Tributo and Spider are rated at 15 mpg in the city and between 18 and 19 mpg on the highway. The cabin's most notable shortcoming concerns rearward visibility in the coupe. The view out the back is impeded by the rear window's louvers. Many exotics are very low on cargo space, and the F8 is no exception. Cargo capacity stands at seven cubic feet in the coupe.</p>",

      '<p className="text-base xs:text-md font-normal pt-2 px-2"><p className="text-2xl xs:text-lg text-blue-500 font-normal pt-2 px-2">First Hydrogen Powered SUV - Pininfarina NamX - What to Expect in future? </p>There is an automotive revolution in the world of automobiles, the first of which is NAMX, which is the first hydrogen car powered by a fuel cell, and the second is the ATLAS car, the innovation of Syed Rachid El Yazami, and overtakes Tesla in a charging time of less than 10 minutes.<a rel="nofollow" href="https://pininfarina.it/en/">Pininfarina</a>, an italian car design firm and an Afro-European company called <a rel="nofollow" href="https://pininfarina.it/en/">NamX</a>{\' \'}has teamed up to develop the world’s first hydrogen-powered SUV, called the HUV. Morocco-French businessman Faouzi Annajah, founder of NamX, has co-created the world’s first car partially powered by a patented removable hydrogen tank system. Morocco is currently the largest car manufacturing base in the Mediterranean region. <p className="text-base xs:text-md font-normal pt-2 px-2"> and number one car manufacturer in Africa with so many international car parts production facilities from around the globe. </p> <p className="text-base xs:text-md font-normal pt-2 px-2"> Also Morocco invested billions of Dollars in Solar and Wind energy production with projects of producing Green Hydrogen from clean sources of Energy. </p> <p className="text-base xs:text-md font-normal pt-2 px-2"> The geopolitical problems facing Europe nowadays with the war in Ukraine, the instability of the fossil energy markets and the gas emissions challenges, Morocco is a reliable partner for France and Europe in general to supply Green Hydrogen which is the future of clean energy. </p> <p className="text-base xs:text-md font-normal pt-2 px-2"> Set to be released in 2025, NamX responds to the rising demand for hydrogen and hybrid cars amid an increasingly prevailing shift towards clean energy sources and decarbonization worldwide. The company plans to establish its market firm in UAE. </p><p className="text-base xs:text-md font-normal pt-2 px-2">NamX’s patented technology consists of a fixed hydrogen tank and six removable capsules. So it is reusable, and sustainable capsules.Someone who loves a ferrari V8 engine which works on an engine with eight cylinders that is mounted on a crankcase featuring two banks of four cylinders each sharing a common crankshaft will also love this concept Hydrogen powered SUV that has six capsules.</p><p className="text-base xs:text-md font-normal pt-2 px-2"><p className="text-2xl xs:text-lg text-blue-500 font-normal pt-2 px-2">Is hydrogen better than electric cars?</p>Both electric and Hydrogen are renewable source of energy, one is produced from solar which is converted to electricity and other is produced by varoius method such as electrolysis, carbonmonoxide reaction with water and so. Electric can provide only 100 to 200 miles per charging while hydropowered cars can produce upto 300 to 500 miles per charged capsules. </p><p className="text-base xs:text-md font-normal pt-2 px-2"> Today we have other hydrogen powered car such as Toyota Mirai, Hyundai tuscon, Honda clarity, Hyundai Nexo. But over last decades, there have never been an increase of sales of Hydrogen powered cars over the sales of BEVs (Battery Electric Vehicles). Why is that so? "Explosion of Hydrogen chemical plants" most probaly the reason for its low sale. In 2020, there were only about 540 plants producing hydrogen. And addition to this there were many cases of explosion. It is not a wonder that similar can happen in car of hydrogen powered cars which stores highly compressed hydrogen gas. </p><p className="text-base xs:text-md font-normal pt-2 px-2"><p className="text-2xl xs:text-lg text-blue-500 font-normal pt-2 px-2">What is the solution? And how can we increase the sale of Hydrogen powered cars?</p>The highly compressed hydrogen gas inside the pipe, its trasportation and its storage. Many researches should be done one safe trasportation and storage of highly compressed hydrogen inside the plants. Whichever the car it may be, be it toyota or Pininfarina NamX or Honda or Hyundai, the companies much make sure the pipe are highly sealed for the compressed car to be stores right below the cars. So that there won\'t be any chance of explosion after the collision. This incase increases the number of Hydrogen plants and make it possible for the Next-gen Hydrogen Powered fuel Cars! </p></p><p className="text-base xs:text-md font-normal pt-2 px-2">Check out the Video on new launch of Hydrogen powered SUV Pininfarina and NamX<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DY0iw8vtOZ8" title="hydrogen fuel" frameBorder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowFullScreen></iframe> </p>&nbsp;</div></div></div>',
